<<<<<<< HEAD:Primitive Master Subfolders 39-45/README.txt
This is a rough draft of the master ACD subfolders.
It contains samples for the AP labs throughout the year
(all code is provided here, but only the class files will be given to students for each lab).
Labs are numbered based on the order of the README on the ACD repository (github).
First upload: contains labs 1-13, 21-23, 26-44.

Things to note:
Lab 23 joins labs 13 and 22.
Lab 33 has an extra optional feature (shows grass being mowed).
^Feel free to add any "extra" labs (please label with an "a" Ex. 33a).
Lab 42 is a modified drag lab (We weren't sure how to refine the rectangle class because it 
already has a contains method). 
Lab 44 does not add on to lab 43 (please share ideas to make this happen).
