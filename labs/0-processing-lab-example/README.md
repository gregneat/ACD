# Processing lab proof of concept

Contains a rewrite of the first lab in the ACD repository in Processing to highlight the similarities and differences of the two frameworks.

Requires the installation of Processing, which can be found in the `labs/lib` directory under the name `core.jar`. See the [README](https://github.com/gregneat/ACD/tree/processing/labs/lib) in that directory for installation instructions.
