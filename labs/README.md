# Example Lab Directory

This directory serves as an example of what a possible lab structure would look like. It demonstrates two concepts that could be used in the ACD: *processing* and *test driven development*

### Processing

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a java library which is similar to objectdraw and could serve as an alternative to JFrame.
