# Required jar files

These are the .jar files that allow for testing and for processing.

### Installation instructions

#### Mac

Drag and drop the files in this directory into the directory ~/Library/Java/Extensions

__Note:__ finding the Library directory might be difficult, as it is hidden by default to prevent people who don't know what they're doing to accidentally break something. The easiest way to access this directory is opening Finder, and at the very top of the screen in the menu bar there should be a dropdown window titled "go". Click on that, and while it's open, hold down `OPTION+SHIFT` at the same time, and the Library option should show up. Click that and find the directory from there

#### PC

Drag and drop the files in this directory into the directory C:\Program Files\Java\jdk(YOUR-VERSION)\jre\lib\ext

__Note:__ I'm on mac right now, so I haven't had the chance to test this. From what I've researched it seems like it would have the same fuctionality as the mac version.
