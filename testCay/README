The code in the testCay folder is a potential new objectdraw.  I would like to have some mouse event capability in the 
client file.  This would be like an onMouseClick just like in objectdraw and like objectdraw, have the actionListener stuff
hidden from the client.  I would also like to have a keystroke capability like in Unity.  Ideally, the client would be
able to fill in the body of a method that would execute when a certain key is pressed.
